        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Harvey Moc. I am an Asian-American student at the University of California: Riverside. I am a first-year currently majoring in Pre-Business. Looking to concentrate in either Business Administration or International Marketing. I am looking to get a degree in business, and hopefully get a well-paying job after college.<br><br>

        Growing up, I grew up to having a passion in Business. I was inspired by all of the rich business people in the world, working for themselves. In high school, I took in some volunteering experience for a service club. I went to marathons, food banks, bubble runs, etc. Through these services, I learned that this is a lot like working. I learned that when I am given a task, I should complete it right away. After everything, this built interest in me to work more and harder, and for the better of the community. Therefore, I seek to develop a business that will benefit the community and overall make my family proud. I also enjoy the aspect of buying and selling products because it is something that I enjoy to do and find peace in. I find it very satisfying when I am able to purchase something or see that a sale that I was able to complete. I also gained interest in business from my cousins because my entire family is pursuing business, so I wanted to continue that and hopefully we can all become successfull business leaders in the future.<br><br>

        Some little information about me is that first things foremost, I love basketball. Basketball is an obsession that runs through my family. When I was younger, my favorite basketball player was Kevin Durant. From all the clutch moments to all the crazy scoring games; he has been my favorite player when he was on the Oklahoma City Thunder, to the Golden State Warriors, to the Brooklyn Nets, and now the Phoenix Suns. He has inspired me to work hard and one day I will be in the upper leagues and be recognized by those around me. Despite all of that, I cherish family and friendships. I will always look to look after my friends and family before anything because they mean the most to me and give me purpose in life. In my spare time, I love to watch movies and shows. My favorite movies are any movie that is made from Marvel. One of my favorite animated show is Naruto which has so much suspense and excitement built into it. Another netflix show that I love is Peaky Blinders because it has such a good history and story to it along with all the action scenes. I am overall a fun guy, as I like to make jokes and make friends laugh. I love to adventure and go to retreats with friends because it makes me feel relaxed and at peace. Lastly, I love to go to the gym in my spare time. I enjoy lifting weight to bodybuild as it gives me a lot of motivation to continue and it also makes me more confident.
